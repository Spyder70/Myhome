# Myhome
I used the most recent technologies for this project, including React Router Dom V6 for Routing (Single Page Application), Bootstrap 5 CSS for designing, and Firebase V9, the newest one from Google, for the back-end. In this project, Firebase uses hooks and has routes that are protected. I have also defined rules for the Firebase database.
